* .zshrc.d
This folder is a modular zshrc file. Files in this folder are named in
a standard form for and loaded by [[../.zshrc][.zshrc]].
* Behavior
1. Scripts are sourced into the environment in lexicographic order.
2. Only sources scripts that are either marked as "base", the current
   `$HOST`, or the current `$USER` are loaded.
3. If there are two scripts with the same load number, the one that is
   most specific will be preferred.  (`$USER`, `$HOST`, "base" is the
   order of specificity.)
   - Technically anything before the first hypen counts, I just prefer
     numbers.
