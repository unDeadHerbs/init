## Global settings (useful for setting up in /etc/wgetrc).
## Think well before you change them, since they may reduce wget's
## functionality, and make it behave contrary to the documentation:
##

# You can lower (or raise) the default number of retries when
# downloading a file (default is 20).
#tries = 20

# Lowering the maximum depth of the recursive retrieval is handy to
# prevent newbies from going too "deep" when they unwittingly start
# the recursive retrieval.  The default is 5.
#reclevel = 5

# The "wait" command below makes Wget wait between every connection.
# If, instead, you want Wget to wait only between retries of failed
# downloads, set waitretry to maximum number of seconds to wait (Wget
# will use "linear backoff", waiting 1 second after the first failure
# on a file, 2 seconds after the second failure, etc. up to this max).
#waitretry = 10

##
## Local settings (for a user to set in his $HOME/.wgetrc).  It is
## *highly* undesirable to put these settings in the global file, since
## they are potentially dangerous to "normal" users.
##
## Even when setting up your own ~/.wgetrc, you should know what you
## are doing before doing so.
##

# It is a good idea to make Wget send your email address in a `From:'
# header with your request (so that server administrators can contact
# you in case of errors).  Wget does *not* send `From:' by default.
#header = From: Your Name <username@site.domain>

# Setting this to off makes Wget not download /robots.txt.  Be sure to
# know *exactly* what /robots.txt is and how it is used before changing
# the default!
robots = off

# It can be useful to make Wget wait between connections.  Set this to
# the number of seconds you want Wget to wait.
wait = 1

# You can turn on recursive retrieving by default (don't do this if
# you are not sure you know what it means) by setting this to on.
#recursive = off

# To always back up file X as X.orig before converting its links (due
# to -k / --convert-links / convert_links = on having been specified),
# set this variable to on:
#backup_converted = off

# To have Wget follow FTP links from HTML files by default, set this
# to on:
#follow_ftp = off

# To try ipv6 addresses first:
prefer-family = IPv6

# Set default IRI support state
#iri = off

# Turn on to prevent following non-HTTPS links when in recursive mode
#httpsonly = off

# Tune HTTPS security (auto, SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1, PFS)
#secureprotocol = auto


# Continue getting a partially-downloaded file.  This is useful when
# you want to finish up a download started by a previous instance of
# Wget, or by another program.  If set to on, force continuation of
# preexistent partially retrieved files. See ‘-c’ before setting it.
continue = on


# If a file is downloaded more than once in the same directory, Wget’s
# behavior depends on a few options, including ‘-nc’.  In certain
# cases, the local file will be “clobbered”, or overwritten, upon
# repeated download.  In other cases it will be preserved.
#
# When running Wget without ‘-N’, ‘-nc’, ‘-r’, or ‘-p’, downloading
# the same file in the same directory will result in the original copy
# of FILE being preserved and the second copy being named ‘FILE.1’.
# If that file is downloaded yet again, the third copy will be named
# ‘FILE.2’, and so on.  (This is also the behavior with ‘-nd’, even if
# ‘-r’ or ‘-p’ are in effect.)  When ‘-nc’ is specified, this behavior
# is suppressed, and Wget will refuse to download newer copies of
# ‘FILE’. Therefore, “‘no-clobber’” is actually a misnomer in this
# mode—it’s not clobbering that’s prevented (as the numeric suffixes
# were already preventing clobbering), but rather the multiple version
# saving that’s prevented.
no_clobber = on
