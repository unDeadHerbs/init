* uDH's init Files

This is a collection of config files that I actively use and want
synchronized across computers.  This is such that consistency is
exists between computers and future computers are just an import away.

* Interesting Files
The most intresting files to look at are my [[home/.dotemacs.org][emacs config]] and my [[home/.zshrc.d/][zsh
config]].

* Install

To install on linux run:

```bash
./install.sh
```

The Windews PowerShell script is still under testing, since I don't
use Windows often.
