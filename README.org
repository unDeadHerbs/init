* uDH's init Files
This is a collection of config files that I actively use and want
synchronized across computers.  This is such that consistency is
exists between computers and future computers are just an import away.
* Interesting Files
The most intresting files to look at are my [[home/.dotemacs.org][emacs config]], my [[home/.zshrc.d/][zsh
config]], and my [[gitconfig][git config]].
* Clone
It's only worth cloning only `--depth 1` most of the time.
* Install
To install on linux run:
```bash
./install.sh
```
The Windews PowerShell script is still under testing, since I don't
use Windows often.
