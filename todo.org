* TODO probably a license or something?
* TODO .dotemacs.org general
  1. M-! does not use the .zshrc file
  2. have tab size and indent mode be buffer local
  3. make lisp mode not use tabs
  4. have magit status refresh on M-!
  5. have tab mode be buffer local and ban tabs from org mode
  6. have flycheck-clang-language-standard set by inspecting make
* TODO .i3 config positioning
  have the configs be links not generated
  - done for i3 but not i3 status
* TODO init.sh experience
  5. some form of version numbers
     when git pull succeeds on .zshrc it can rerun install.sh
* TODO add common README.md sections for github
* TODO make screen more consistent with tmux, just in case
* TODO .zshrc
  1. move rc options to the correct env var or file rather than alias
  2. make sudo alias more consistant with sudo
     the real sudo can't accept commands in '' marks
  3. when posible, prevent re-assiging to a export
     the editor variable is reexported 6 times
  4. disable the motd on ssh if it's just the cow
     that fills up the buffer and the clear is annoying
* TODO git have the commands lt and ll look at how big my terminal is
* TODO git Fetch-Merge-FastForward
  fmff="find divergence with upstream, move back to it, re-base all new commits on origin"
  that might just be the re-base command if i do it right
